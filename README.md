Hello there, I'm Dandyboi, but you can call me Michael. I'm from JÃ¤mtland, Sweden.

I speak English, Swedish, Spanish, and German. I typically write my code in JS, HTML, CSS, Python, and Lua. I do a little BASIC on the side with my Commodore machines.I occasionally dabble in Blender, JExcel, and Desmos, and I also enjoy modifying ID3 and EXIF data. I enjoy studying the decompiling of data and files, as well as studying the graphing and plotting of data.
